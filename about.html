	  <br><p>Polish cuisine consists of mixture of several different cuisines - German, Ruthenian, French, Jewish and Italian. For centuries, Polish cuisine has mainly contained regional ingredients such as venison, mushrooms and forest fruits, as well as vegetables and grains. Grains have been used in many popular flour-based dishes that were once the fundamental to the diet of Polish residents. In olden times, only food that could be hunted and grown in the immediate vicinity was often eaten in Poland.</p><br>
    
      <p>As mentioned, the diet of Poles used to be based on grains such as barley, millet and groats, furthermore flour-based dishes were supplemented with wild boar, doe, hare,deer, honey, mushrooms and freshwater fish - tench, zander, carp, perch and pike. In their kitchens, the Slavs also used meat from farm animals â€“ sheep, pig and cattle, which also supplied milk for making cheese. Polish cuisine is also rich in herbs including those typically used for venison, e.g. juniper, but also nutmeg and pepper. Ever since the times of queen Bona, the menu includes vegetables such as cabbage, peas, beans, turnips, carrots, beets and cucumbers.</p><br>

      <p>Polish cuisine is characterized by a wide use of various types of pickling and soups. Pickled cucumbers or cabbage are an integral part of many dishes. Soups can be both thin or thick - with the addition of pasta, rice or potatoes.</p>
